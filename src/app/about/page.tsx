            ZED Gift Shop started with a simple frustration: the best gifts in Kenya were hard to find, and the
            personal ones took weeks. We wanted fast, beautiful, heartfelt gifting — so we built it.

            Every order at ZED is picked by hand, wrapped with care, and personalized to your message. From engraved
            keepsakes and mugs to custom hampers and corporate gift boxes, we obsess over the details that turn a
            present into a memory.

            We&apos;re based in Nairobi and we know Kenyan occasions — birthdays, weddings, Ruracio, baby showers,
            graduations, Eid, Christmas and the countless moments in between. When the date matters, we deliver.
          </p>
          <p>
            Big or small, one gift or a hundred, we&apos;d love to help you make someone&apos;s day.
