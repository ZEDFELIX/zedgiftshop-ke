  {
    q: "How do I pay?",
    a: "We accept M-PESA via STK Push. When you place your order we send a payment request straight to your M-PESA number â€” approve it with your PIN and your order is confirmed instantly.",
  },
  {
    q: "When will my order arrive?",
    a: "Orders placed before 5:00pm are delivered the same day within Nairobi. Countrywide deliveries usually arrive in 1â€“3 working days for major towns and 2â€“7 working days for the rest of Kenya, with tracking.",
  },
  {
    q: "How is delivery charged?",
    a: "Delivery is calculated at checkout based on your county and town, and shown before you pay. Same-day Nairobi delivery is a flat cost (free over the current threshold). You'll see the exact fee right in the checkout summary.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can I send a gift to someone else?",
    a: "Yes. Enter the recipient's name, phone and address at checkout. We'll deliver straight to them, wrap it beautifully, and never include the price on the delivery slip.",
  },
  {
    q: "What can I personalize?",
    a: "Many of our gifts can be engraved, printed or customized â€” mugs, t-shirts, frames, keyholders, hampers and more. Look for 'Personalize' on product pages and add names, dates or short messages.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can I include a gift message?",
    a: "Of course. Add a handwritten-style gift note at checkout on selected products â€” it's included in a classic ZED gift box.",
  },
  {
    q: "What if my gift arrives damaged or wrong?",
    a: "Contact us within 48 hours with your order number and photos. We'll arrange a replacement or full refund at no cost to you.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can I return a personalized gift?",
    a: "Because personalized and engraved items are made exactly to your specifications, they aren't returnable unless they arrive faulty or wrong.",
  },
  {
    q: "Do you do corporate and bulk gifts?",
    a: "Yes. We handle corporate gifting, team gifts and bulk orders â€” visit the Corporate gifts page or email us and we'll follow up.",
  },
